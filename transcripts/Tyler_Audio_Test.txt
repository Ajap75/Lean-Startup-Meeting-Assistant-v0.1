 I do not exceed the same Terry ENESI I see all the potential. And I see it wasted. I see an entire generation working at gas stations, serving in restaurants, and enslaving a little boss in an office. Advertising makes us run after cars and clothes. We do jobs we hate to pay for shit that are useless to us. We are forgotten children of history. We have no purpose or real place. We have no great war. No great depression. Our great war is spiritual. Our great depression is our lives. Television taught us to believe that one day we would all be millionaires, the gods of cinema or rock stars. But it's wrong. And we are slowly learning this truth. We really, really, really hate it.
